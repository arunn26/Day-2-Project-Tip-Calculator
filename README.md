# Tip Calculator

The **Tip Calculator** is a Python program that calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill. It takes the total bill, the tip percentage, and the number of people splitting the bill as inputs, and calculates the total amount each person needs to pay, including the tip.

## Features
- Calculates the tip based on the percentage provided by the user.
- Splits the total bill (including the tip) between multiple people.
- Rounds the amount each person should pay to two decimal places for simplicity.

## Example
```bash
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $150.00
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10 12 15 15
How many people to split the bill? 5
Each person should pay: $34.50
